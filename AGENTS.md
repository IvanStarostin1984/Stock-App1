# Contributor Guidelines for Stock-App1

This repository hosts a cross-platform stock market app with a Flutter mobile front‑end and a Vue 3 web PWA.  Follow these rules when adding or updating code.

# Important — Not authoritative:
1. This file is only a quick-start contributor guide.
2. For any requirement or design decision, /docs (SRS_v1.md, SDD_v1.md, original_assignment.md) is the sole authority; this file is only a convenience summary.
3. If following SRS_v1.md, SDD_v1.md produces a conflict, or not working code, treat original_assignment.md as single source of truth. Inform end-user about such situation with *IMPORTANT* disclaimer.
4. Always consult those documents first and treat AGENTS.md as secondary.
5. End-user of codex may explicitly ask to modify SRS_v1.md and/or SDD_v1.md, in that case comply.

#Distinct-files rule:
1. Every concurrent task must confine its edits to a unique list of code or data files.
2. Shared exceptions: any task may append (never rewrite) the markdown logs NOTES.md, TODO.md, and this AGENTS.md.
3. If two or more open PRs would touch the same non-markdown file, cancel or re-scope one of them before continuing.

## Required Tools
- **Node 20** for the web app.
- **Flutter 3.22** for the mobile app.
- `openapi-generator-cli` (`openapitools.json` pins version 7.13.0) to refresh API clients under `packages/`.
- Charting stack is fixed to **Chart.js 4.4.9 (UMD, SRI-pinned)** and **fl_chart 0.66.x**; CI fails on drift.

## Setup & Build
1. Clone the repo and generate REST clients:
   ```bash
   cd packages
   npm run gen:clients
   cd ..
   ```
   This script replaces running `npm run gen:ts` and `npm run gen:dart` separately.
2. Mobile app:
   ```bash
   cd mobile-app
   flutter pub get && flutter run
   ```
3. Web app:
   ```bash
   cd web-app
   npm install && npm run dev
   ```
4. When TypeScript files outside `web-app/src/` are imported (e.g. under
   `packages/`), update `web-app/tsconfig.json` to include those paths.
   Missing entries cause TS6307 build failures. Exclude each package's
   `tests/` directory to keep the build fast.

Create identical `.env` files in `mobile-app/` and `web-app/` containing:
```
VITE_MARKETSTACK_KEY=YOUR_MARKETSTACK_KEY
VITE_NEWSDATA_KEY=YOUR_NEWSDATA_KEY
LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN=YOUR_LHCI_TOKEN  # CI only
```
(Exchangerate.host is key-less – no variable needed.)

## API hygiene
API requests are implemented in service classes under `web-app/src/services/`.
Each service uses `LruCache`, `ApiQuotaLedger` and the shared `NetClient`
wrapper to enforce 24 h caching and free‑tier quotas (≤ 100 Marketstack/FX
calls · month⁻¹, ≤ 200 NewsData calls · day⁻¹).
(See *docs/SRS_v1.md § 9.6.7 Limitations*.)

## Coding Standards
- One domain concept per file; no cyclic imports.
- Functions should stay under 20 lines with at most 2 nesting levels.
- Favour composition over inheritance and keep variables scoped tightly.
- Validate inputs early and throw on bad data.
- Secrets must remain in `.env`; never commit real API keys.
- Use 2‑space indentation, single quotes and end files with a newline.
- Document each public API/function with a doc comment.
- Log `loadTimeMs` and external API latency in debug builds.
- State management: Riverpod (Flutter) and Pinia (Vue) – avoid global singletons.
- The generic parameter of `NetClient.get<T>` must match the transform function's
  return type.
(These frameworks are planned; current code does not yet use them.)

## Testing & CI
- Run `dart format`, `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, `eslint --fix`, and `npm test` before committing.
- `flutter analyze` at the repo root uses `analysis_options.yaml` which includes
  `mobile-app/analysis_options.yaml` and excludes generated design tokens.
- Run `npm install` in `web-app/` before tests so the style-dictionary build step works.
- Run `npm run tokens` (or run tests) before any Flutter analysis or build steps so `tokens.dart` exists.
- Provide at least one positive and one negative unit test per public API, aiming for ≥75 % branch coverage.
- GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` will build the web app, run tests, trigger a Netlify deployment and execute Lighthouse CI. Keep the pipeline green.

# Quality gates
* **Lighthouse** perf & a11y ≥ 90 or CI fails.  
* **Core Web Vitals** budget: LCP ≤ 2.5 s, CLS < 0.10.  
* **Axe-core** a11y violations = 0.  
* **Flutter** frame time ≤ 16 ms (DevTools trace).  
* WCAG 2.1 AA colour contrast verified via axe-lint.

### Requirement traceability

* **Always comment generated code with requirement IDs** (`FR-`, `US-`, `QR-`, etc).  
  Example:
  ```dart
  /// FR-123 – Place trade order
  /// US-04  – “As a user, I can buy stocks…”
  /// QR-02  – < 200 ms round-trip
  ```

## Contributing Workflow
- **Fork** then branch off `main` using the pattern `feat/<topic>`.
- **Ensure local tests pass** before opening a PR.
- **Each PR requires at least one reviewer.**

## Decision & Progress Logging
To keep project history and reasoning transparent **and** trace every change back to official documentation,  
**every contribution must include**:

### PR Decision Checklist *(in the PR description)*
- **Major design decisions** and their rationale  
- **Any deviations** from `/docs` (`SRS_v1.md`, `SDD_v1.md`) or this `AGENTS.md`  
- **Blockers / limitations**, e.g., failing tests or unmet dependencies  
- **Requirements addressed**: list the exact IDs touched, e.g.  
  `FR-01`, `US-03`, `QR-02` <br>
  *(Use the IDs defined in `SRS_v1.md` § 4 “Functional Requirements”, § 5 “User Stories”,  
  and `SDD_v1.md` § 7 “Quality Requirements”.)*

### Progress Log (`Notes.md`)
Append **one new section at the top of `NOTES.md`** (newest entry first) using this template:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD PR #<number>
- **Summary**: …
- **Stage**: …
- **Requirements addressed**: FR-01, US-03, QR-02
- **Deviations/Decisions**: …
- **Next step**: …
- **Notes**: … (optional)
```
Agents MUST consult Notes.md and the referenced requirement IDs before starting work
to understand the current stage, past decisions, and open questions tied to the spec.

Refer to `README.md` and full documentation in `docs/` for further details on features and architecture.

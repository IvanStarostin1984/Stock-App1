Frontend Programming Final Exam Project
Frontend Programming
Final exam project and presentation
Your final project for the Frontend Programming course involves programming a 
Mobile Native app (Part 1) and designing an interactive responsive Web App (Part 
2).
The Mobile Native App must be programmed and installed on an Android mobile 
device, or it should function on an Android Emulator. Additionally, the app must 
be compatible with both Apple and Android devices, depending on the available 
computer and mobile phone.
The Web App should be published on a free hosting service. A list of free hosting 
websites can be found at the following link: https://www.techradar.com/web-
hosting/best-free-web-hosting .
Both the Web App and the Mobile App will display the current stock 
market information from an API, related to the user's current location, date, 
and time. For an example of a Stock Market Web App, you can visit the following 
link: https://www.tradingview.com/

1- Stock Market Mobile App Requirements
The Stock Market Native App must work on an Android Emulator using Android 
Studio, or it can be presented during the final exam presentation on an Android 
physical device. The mobile app must be programmed with Dart using Flutter 
only; other programming languages will not be accepted.
The app must display the stock market prices with fitting visual language (such as 
changing text colors - red for the stock prices going down, green for the stock 
prices going up, etc.). The data should be visualized with tables and charts. The 
country name should be determined automatically from the Geolocator in the 
mobile device, or it can be provided by the users. Stock information can be 
collected using a free plan of an API such as: https://marketstack.com/
Users should be able to open the Stock Market Web Page from the Mobile App to 
view, for example, detailed charts of the last week.

Please create a simple app design and functionality to ensure a working app at the 
exam. The functionality of the app is more important than the design.
2- IT AGILE Development Requirements
In agile, the work is always a collaborative effort. So you will be doing this in 
groups. The Development should be executed in SCRUM according to the 
Frameworks rules.
Sprint Planning
To Process the initial requirements to address the content of the following 
points Pre-development process:
Requirements gathering through list of client requirements and software
specifications
Requirement analysis and definition to conclude list of functions and
features in each interface to be discussed in details with complete software 
interactions (input [functional] + output [nonfunctional] + behavior) for each 
interface (SRS).
From the details provided with this document and SRS about software 
product specifications, create and priorities' jobs list with the development 
team to prepare product backlog to be declared via Jira platform.
Sort this tasks into a logical sequence for the development. Estimate and
Prioritize them accordingly.
Then select number of tasks to be grouped and implemented by sprints
Sprint –1- Design of architecture (show code framework) and graphic design 
that matches the architecture based on client requirements
Sprint –2- Implementation
Sprint –3- Testing
Sprint - 4 Q-Review ( Quality Review )
